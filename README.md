## Framework_GraphAlignment
Implementation of well-known graph aligment methods in Python.
Work in progress.

How to run experiments :
1) python workexp with scaling : This will run the scalability experiment as in the paper/thesis
2) python workexp with tuning : This will run the tunning experiment as in the paper/thesis
3) python workexp with real_noise: This will run the real graphs experiments as in the paper/thesis :MultiMagna,HighSchool,Voles datasets
4) python workexp with real: This will run the high noise experiments as in the paper/thesis 
5) python workexp with arenasish:This will run the random graph experiment+ arenas dataset as in the paper/thesis
